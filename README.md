Digraph Arc Diagrams

The code currently has almost two full sets of implementation.

The following files are part of the model-view-adapter structure I am moving forward with.
 - adapter.py
 - view.py
 - ros_adapter.py
 - qt_view.py
 - ros_qt_view.py
 - SpacerContainer.py

The following files are part of the core infastructure
 - topology.py
 - ros_topology.py
 - util.py
 - test.py
 - parser.py
 - ros_parser.py

The following files are considered deprecated - they need to be ported forward to the new MVA 
 - asciiplot.py
 - asciidraw.py
 - ros_diarc.py (has been mostly ported)
 - qtview.py (has been ported)
